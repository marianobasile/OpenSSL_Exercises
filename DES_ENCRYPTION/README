DES_ENCRYPTION

Client-server application for confidential file exchange.
● Client and server share a symmetric cryptographic key (hard-coded in the program).
● The client reads a file, encrypts it, and sends it through a stream socket.
● The server receives the encrypted data, decrypts it, and saves it on a local file.
