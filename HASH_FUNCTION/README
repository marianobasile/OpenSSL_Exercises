HASH_FUNCTION

The client reads a file, and sends it to the server, following the schema:
Ek1(m, Hk2(m)),
where:
● m is the content of the file
● k1 and k2 are shared keys
● Ek1() is a symmetric encryption function (DES in CBC mode)
● Hk2() is a keyed hash function (HMAC-MD5)
● The server decrypts the message received from the client, verifies its authenticity, and saves it on a local file.
● Different keys are used for authenticating and encrypting
● The authentication key must be as long as an MD5 digest: 16 bytes.
