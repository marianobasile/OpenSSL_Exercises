ASYMMETRIC_ENCRYPTION

● On the server, generate a pair of 1024-bit RSA keys, by using OpenSSL
command-line tools.
● Give the public key to the client.
● The client reads a file, envelopes it with the server's public key (DES in CBC),and sends to the server:

● the encrypted symmetric key,
● the initialization vector,
● the ciphertext.
● The server decrypts the message and saves it on a local file.
